I am Rahul Pawar, a Graduate Student at Nagindas Khandwala College in Mumbai pursuing Masters in Information Technology.
As a part of my Google Summer of Code 2020 Internship at the Mifos Initiative, I have been working on <b>'Apache Fineract Credit Bureau Integration Phase 3'.</b>
Currently, there is no feature for reporting credit history in Fineract. This Project has done the <b>Integration of ThitsaWorks Credit Bureau (Myanmar) with the Apache Fineract</b>, where the user will need
to enter the <b>NRC number from Mifos-UI</b> and while passing the request, in Backend-Fineract the configuration-data(username,password,subscriptionKey,SubscriptionId and Token) will be fetched from the Database as required,
and then from Fineract the request will be pass to the External API of Credit Bureau and <b>fetch the Credit History and display it to the user</b>.<br>
In this project a <b>Generic Request-Response Architecture</b> for Credit Bureau which will be Implemented and will be used for the current ThitsaWorks Credit Bureau and also will be used while Integrating with more Credit Bureau's in Future. </p><br>
