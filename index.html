I am Rahul Pawar, a Graduate Student at Nagindas Khandwala College in Mumbai pursuing Masters in Information Technology.
As a part of my Google Summer of Code 2020 internship at the Mifos Initiative, I have been working on 'Apache Fineract Credit Bureau Integration phase 3'.
Currently, there is no feature for reporting credit history in Fineract. This module will give ability to clients to check the credit history of the loan applicant and consequently mitigate the risk to bad debt.
Along with checking, this Module would also allow client organizations to report to credit bureaus. </p><br>
